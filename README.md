# JpegModelCUDA
JPEG Model including Fourier DCT and Zigzag transformation with CUDA parallel computing.
However, the Huffman compression algorithm is not here.<br>
The comparison of CPU and GPU running the same functions of code is presented in the printout report; both of code are highly optimized.<br>
My test result shows that GPU is usually over Five Thousand times faster than single core CPU.
